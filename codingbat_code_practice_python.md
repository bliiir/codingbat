I am learning Python and R as part of a data-science track on Coursera and I was looking for some small problems to solve to really get into the mindset. As I looked I found [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com/) which was just what I was looking for.

I am publishing the solutions to the problems to:

* Get in the habit of using Git and Github
* Get in the habit of writing Markdown reports
* Get in the habit of sharing like I have benefitted from others doing
* To get a little better at rudimentary coding before I do my next [trading bot]()

The site has [Java](http://codingbat.com/java) and [Python](http://codingbat.com/python) puzzles. Very small and quite fun.

Below are the links to the Python puzzles. The first ones are very easy and the last ones can be a bit challenging to come up with a short and precise solution for.

Thank you to [Nick Parlante](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~nick) for making Codingbat.

* [Warmup-1](http://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-1)  
Simple warmup problems to get started, no loops

* [Warmup-2](http://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-2)  
Medium warmup string/list problems with loops

* [String-1](http://codingbat.com/python/String-1)  
Basic python string problems -- no loops

* [List-1](http://codingbat.com/python/List-1)  
Basic python list problems -- no loops.

* [Logic-1](http://codingbat.com/python/Logic-1)
