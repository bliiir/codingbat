I am learning Python and R as part of a data-science track on Coursera and I was looking for some small problems to solve to really get into the mindset. As I looked I found [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com/) which was just what I was looking for.

I am publishing the solutions to the problems to:

* Get in the habit of using Git and Github
* Get in the habit of writing Markdown reports
* Get in the habit of sharing like I have benefitted from others doing
* To get a little better at rudimentary coding before I do my next [trading bot]()

The site has [Java](http://codingbat.com/java) and [Python](http://codingbat.com/python) puzzles. Very small and quite fun.
